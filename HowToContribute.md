# Contributing to the Kin Rewards Engine

Thank you for taking the time to contributing to the mission of building a better digital world, with developers, consumers, and content-creators at the center. 

## How To Contribute
Review this guide before submitting issues or requests.

### Contributing to Existing Proposals & Documents

- Create an "Issue" within an existing proposal in order to start a new thread with your conceptual suggestion for change, questions, or discussions. You can do this by clicking on "Issues" and then "New Issue". Preferably, include a link to the exact proposal that you are discussing, for reference. Note that only improvement proposals in the improvement-proposals directory [(Improvement Proposals)](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals) can be changed.

### Submitting KRE Algorithm and Spend Guideline Improvement Proposals

1. Location: Please use the improvement-proposals directory [(Improvement Proposals)](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals) to submit pull requests with new proposed KRE iterations. 

2. Template: Use the [improvement proposal template](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals/improvement-proposal-template.md) as a sample template to submit proposals to improve (i) the Kin Rewards Engine and its underlying mathematics & economics and (ii) the "Valid Spend Guidelines" which determine the definition of valid work in the Kin Ecosystem to be compensated in Kin.

### General Rules
Please follow these rules when suggesting improvements:

- When appropriate, you can also comment on specific line changes. 

- Discussion on this repo must relate to contents discussed in one of the improvement proposals.

- Please keep discussion civil.

Discussions not adhering to the following rules will be closed.

## Process 
Proposal submissions are reviewed by the Kin Foundation and accepted, denied, or modified at their own discretion. When a new proposal has been picked up for consideration, it will be merged into the improvement-proposals directory [(Improvement Proposals)](rewards-engine/improvement-proposals), shortly after which a window of time will be specified by the Kin Foundation for comments (via issues) and proposed changes (pull requests) to be reviewed. This process will iterate over time at the discretion of the Kin Foundation.
