# Kin Improvement Proposal
The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed improvement to the existing KRE algorithm and/or valid spend guidelines. 

*versioning:*
- *if an update to an existing algorithm, it should be an incremental update (e.g. 1.1, 1.2)*
- *if suggesting to update to a new algorithm, it should be a new upgrade (e.g. 2.0, 3.0)*

## Proposed by:
*(optional: insert name or organization)*

## Abstract
*An overview of the proposal. Describe the objectives and rationale behind this improvement proposal here.*

## Summary of Improvements
